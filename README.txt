Simple audio application program (i.e. an app) called MyAudio. The MyAudio app stores and manages audio content of various types (e.g. Songs, Audio Books, Podcasts) in a library. Audio content can be downloaded from a simulated online store. The audio content in the library can be played (i.e. in this app, playing a song means printing its lyrics). Playlists can be created from library content. A playlist can store songs or even a mixture of different types of audio content.
